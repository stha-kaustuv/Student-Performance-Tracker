# Student-Performance-Tracker

# 🎓 Student Performance Tracker (Data Science & ML)

This project is a comprehensive **End-to-End Machine Learning** pipeline designed to analyze and predict student academic performance.It identifies the key behavioral and environmental factors that lead to success in exams.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to move beyond simple grade tracking and understand _why_ students perform the way they do. Using a dataset of 2000-6800 student records, this project handles data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling.

### 🔍 Key Research Questions:

- Does attendance have a higher impact than study hours?
- How do environmental factors like internet access and parental involvement influence scores?
- Can we accurately predict an exam score based on a student's current profile?

<!-- ## 📊 Dataset Insights
From my initial **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, several key correlations were discovered:

| Factor | Correlation with Exam Score | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Attendance** | **0.58** | High Positive Impact |
| **Hours Studied** | **0.45** | Moderate Positive Impact |
| **Previous Scores** | **0.18** | Low Positive Impact |
| **Sleep/Activity** | **~0.00** | Negligible Direct Impact |

> **Insight:** Showing up to class (Attendance) is statistically more important for a high grade than just studying more hours in this specific dataset.
